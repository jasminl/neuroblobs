neuroblobs
==========

A diverse collection of neural network simulations

 1.) Prerequisites
 2.) Building and Installing
 3.) Applications
 
== 1. PREREQUISITES ==

 This project requires:
  * Matlab, or 
  * GNU Octave 3.6.1
 
 Note, the software is tested only on Ubuntu 12.04, but is likely to work on other platforms as well
 as it does not rely on OS-specific function calls.

== 2. BUILDING and INSTALLING ==
 
 No special instructions are needed to build or install the modules in this package. All you
 need to do is clone the repository.

== 3. APPLICATIONS ==

 1. PPCoherence - Computation of point process-based coherence in time-series
 2. stocktrade - Applies point process coherence to the analysis of stock trades
 3. rulkov - Implements a map-based neuron model
 4. rescorla_wagner - The Rescorla-Wagner model of learning
