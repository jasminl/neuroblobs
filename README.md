 1.) Prerequisites
 2.) Building and Installing
 3.) Applications
 
**1. PREREQUISITES**

 This project requires:
  * Matlab (preferably), or 
  * GNU Octave 3.8.1 with the following packages:
    - general (> 1.3.4)
    - signal (> 1.3.0)
    - control (> 2.6.4)
    - image (> 2.2.1)
 
 Note, the software is tested only on Ubuntu 12.04, but is likely to work on other platforms as well
 as it does not rely on OS-specific function calls.

**2. BUILDING and INSTALLING**
 
 No special instructions are needed to build or install the modules in this package. All you
 need to do is clone the repository.

**3. APPLICATIONS**

 1. PPCoherence - Computation of point process-based coherence in time-series
 2. stocktrade - Applies point process coherence to the analysis of stock trades. Free sample data from [tickdata](http://www.tickdata.com) is provided here for testing (cf. share folder).
 3. rulkov - Implements a map-based neuron model
 4. rescorla_wagner - The Rescorla-Wagner model of learning
 5. reinforce - Predictive Hebbian learning
